##Purpose: This script processes two data sets from the CIA World Factbook. Two
##independent text files, one for population and one for internet users, are
##merged by country, then a fourth field is added for percentage internet users,
##and finally the percentage of the polulation that uses the internet is
##calculated and input into the new field. This data serves as the basis for my
##leaflet map.
